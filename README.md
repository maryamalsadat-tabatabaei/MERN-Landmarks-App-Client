## Project Background

This project is based on Maximilian Schwarzmüller's tutorial on Udemy React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide. I have made modifications and added new features to extend the functionality of the original project and I built upon that foundation to extend the project's functionality and address specific requirements. However, the core concept and initial implementation were inspired by the course and the work of the original author.

## New Features

1. **Cache Functionality**: Implemented the ability to cache places by userId using Redis. This caching mechanism improves performance by reducing the need for repetitive database queries.

2. **Integration Test**: Added unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application. 

These additional features enhance the capabilities of the original project and provide added value in terms of functionality, performance, or user experience. They were implemented based on the requirements and insights gained from the course, as well as personal experimentation and problem-solving.

I would like to express my gratitude to the Based on Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course instructors for their teachings and inspiration, which played a significant role in the development of this project. Please note that this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Maximilian Schwarzmüller, and any issues or inquiries regarding this modified version should be directed to my GitHub repository.
